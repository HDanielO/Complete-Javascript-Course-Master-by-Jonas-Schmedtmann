# Complete-Javascript-Course-Master-by-Jonas-Schmedtmann
This Repo contains all projects I built from the Javascript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy

Started this course a long time ago but I have finally decided to upload all the projects I built while taking this course on GitHub.

If you like some of the projects or you are interested in taking the course please check it out on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

Oh and I'll also be building some projects from [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) as I learn more and become better!!
